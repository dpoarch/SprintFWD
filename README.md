### SprintFWD

- Create a Next.js app that includes:
  a.  server-side rendering,
  b.  routing,
  c.  image optimization,
  d.  font optimization.

- At least one of the pages should make an API call to hydrate data (https://mockapi.io/ could be an option to create mock endpoints).
- The app should have at least 3 pages inter-linking between.
- The app should have a nav bar and footer shared across all the pages.

## Getting Started

1. Install all required dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Rename `env.example` to `.env`

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
